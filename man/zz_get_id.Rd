\title{Simple wrapper for Zamzar endpoint returning an id(s) for a posted file(s)}
\usage{
zz_get_id(usr = NULL, latest = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{usr}{The username/API key you are using for Zamzar.
See: https://developers.zamzar.com/user}

\item{latest}{Boolean deciding whether or not we should only return the 
latest target id. If switched to false, will return a list of all assigned
target ids}
}
\value{
A target id or alternatively a list of target ids
}
\description{
Per default zz_get_id() assumes that you only want the target id for the latest 
assigned file. Set latest bool to FALSE to change this behaviour.
}
\details{
Please note: zz_get_id() doesn't differentiate between files that have been
assigned to either the development or production endpoint.
Thus you have to keep track of this yourself.
